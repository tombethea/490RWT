# Telemetry

RedwoodJS collects completely anonymous telemetry data about general usage.

Here is an example JSON packet containing the telemetry data for running yarn rw info:

```json
{
    type: 'command',
    command: 'info',         // actual CLI command that was invoked, including flags
    ci: false,               // whether or not this is running in a CI environment
    duration: 2353,          // how long the process took, in milliseconds
    NODE_ENV: 'development', // the value of NODE_ENV, if set
    complexity: '4.2.6.3',   // a measure of how complex the app is (route, service, cell and page counts)
    system: '8.32',          // cpu core count, memory in GB
    sides: 'web,api',        // sides that are in use
    shell: 'zsh',
    nodeVersion: '14.17.1',
    yarnVersion: '14.17.1',
    npmVersion: '14.17.1',
    vsCodeVersion: '1.58.0',
    redwoodVersion: '0.35.1',
    os: 'macOS',
    osVersion: '11.4',
    system: '8.32'          // number of cpu cores and system memory
  }
```

## How do I turn it off?

Set an environment variable, either in your app's .env file, or anywhere that creates variables for your user space, like `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:

```terminal
REDWOOD_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1
```

## Troubleshooting

If you suspect problems with telemetry when running CRWA, you can set the verbose flag to help diagnose issues.

For example,

```terminal
REDWOOD_VERBOSE_TELEMETRY=true yarn create-redwood-app bazinga
```
